# Changelog

## v0.2.0 — 2026-09-25

### Added
- **Documentation site**, published with GitHub Pages from `docs/` at
  https://ashjha0.github.io/agentic-trader/. The landing page shows measured figures, an
  honesty note, the architectural boundary, component cards, a sample decision and a
  real-price backtest.
- `LEARN.md`: a guided tour through 13 concepts, each with implementation pointers, real
  numbers and questions.
- `COOKBOOK.md`: 25 recipes; all 22 Python recipes are executed when the docs are checked.
- `docs/architecture/overview.md`, `docs/DIAGRAMS.md` (10 Mermaid diagrams),
  `docs/SPECIFICATION.md` (paper and project requirements with status),
  `docs/threat-model/threat-model.md`, `docs/evaluation/evaluation.md`, `docs/api/api.md`,
  `docs/INDEX.md` and `docs/GITHUB_PAGES.md`.
- An evaluation on **real Q1 2024 prices** (Yahoo) for AAPL, NVDA, MSFT, META, GOOGL, EURUSD,
  USDJPY and GBPUSD with the rule-based agents, next to the synthetic results.
- GitHub Actions CI (#1): pytest on Python 3.10–3.14, and a C++ build with ctest and pytest
  on the C++ backend on Linux, Windows and macOS.

### Changed
- `examples/compare_baselines.py` now covers all eight evaluation instruments over the
  documented window (2024-01-02 → 2024-03-28).

## v0.1.0 — 2026-09-25

First release.

- **Agents.** A multi-agent trading firm for equities and FX:
  - analysts: technical, fundamentals or macro/rates, news, sentiment;
  - a bull/bear debate with a facilitator;
  - a trader;
  - an aggressive/neutral/conservative risk team;
  - a portfolio manager with hard limits.
- **LLMs.** Claude through the Anthropic SDK with quick and deep tiers, an offline
  rule-based mode, and a rule-based fallback on any LLM failure.
- **C++17 quant core.** Indicators, risk, the paper's baselines and a backtester, exposed via
  pybind11, with a numpy twin.
- **Data.** Synthetic, Yahoo/FRED and CSV providers with point-in-time guards; decision
  memory with reflection.
- **Tools.** Walk-forward backtesting against the baselines, the `agentic-trader` CLI,
  examples, and the pytest and ctest suites.
